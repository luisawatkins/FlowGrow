# FlowEstate Project Planning

## Background and Motivation

FlowEstate is a decentralized web application that transforms real-world properties into tradeable NFTs on the Flow blockchain. The project aims to create a liquid marketplace where property owners can tokenize their real estate assets and buyers can purchase property NFTs using connected wallets.

### Key Features:
- Property NFT minting with rich metadata (address, description, square footage, price, images)
- Automatic marketplace listing upon minting
- MetaMask wallet integration with Flow EVM Testnet auto-switching
- Real-time marketplace browsing and purchasing
- Transaction monitoring with Flow explorer links
- Off-chain storage for performance and cost efficiency

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Blockchain**: Flow EVM Testnet, MetaMask, Ethers.js/Web3.js
- **Smart Contracts**: ERC-721 NFT + Custom Marketplace contract
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for off-chain metadata
- **Architecture**: Hybrid on-chain/off-chain design

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:
1. **Blockchain Integration**: Flow EVM compatibility, MetaMask configuration, contract deployment
2. **Hybrid Architecture**: Balancing on-chain ownership with off-chain metadata for performance
3. **Real-time Updates**: Synchronizing contract events with database updates
4. **User Experience**: Seamless wallet connection and network switching
5. **Error Handling**: Network failures, transaction failures, database operations
6. **Gas Optimization**: Cost-effective minting and trading patterns

### Business Logic Challenges:
1. **Property Metadata**: Rich, structured data for real estate properties
2. **Marketplace Mechanics**: Listing, purchasing, ownership transfer
3. **Transaction Transparency**: Explorer integration for all operations
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility
